*"You are a technical writer tasked with creating a detailed training guide for Power BI administrators. The guide should explain how to identify and troubleshoot reports that cause high CPU utilization on Power BI capacities. Write it as a structured document with the following sections: Introduction, Symptoms, Detection Methods, Root Cause Analysis, Troubleshooting Steps, Best Practices, Case Studies, Summary, and References. Each section should be at least 2â€“3 paragraphs long with detailed technical explanations and step-by-step guidance. Include examples of real-world scenarios (e.g., inefficient DAX, too many visuals, refresh bottlenecks) and reference specific tools such as the Power BI Metrics app, Activity Log, DAX Studio, and Query Diagnostics. The style should be instructional, technical, and formatted in Markdown for use as an internal training guide."*
